            <p>Economic empowerment is a crucial factor to promote full participation, equality, and economic self-sufficiency for women
				 in their communities. Women are key agents for achieving the economic, environmental, and social changes required for 
				 sustainable development. Their empowerment is key to their well-being, their families and to their communities at large.</p><br>

            <p>A major dimension of women's inequality and dis-empowerment is poverty, due in part to the lack of economic self-sufficiency in addition to their relative lack of access to and ownership of, economic resources in their own right â€“ be this land, property, or money. All these have been recognized as some of the key impediments in the empowerment of women in Africa. A focus on women's economic
			   independence is essential if we are to make real progress towards achieving gender equality, and the empowerment of women 
			   and girls.</p><br>
            <h2>The Issues</h2>
			<p><strong>*</strong>As of 2011, 50.5% of the world's working women were in vulnerable employment, often unprotected by labour 
				legislation, compared to 48.2% for men. Women were far more likely than men to be in vulnerable employment in North Africa
				 (55 versus 32%), the Middle East (42 versus 27%) and sub-Saharan Africa (nearly 85 versus 70 per cent).</p><br>
			<p><strong>*</strong>A study of time and water poverty in 25 sub-Saharan African countries estimated that women spend
				 at least 16 million hours a day collecting drinking water; men spend 6 million hours; and children, 4 million hours. 
				 (World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund, Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation: 2012 Update, 
				 (Geneva, 2012).</p><br>
			<p><strong>*</strong>Women bear disproportionate responsibility for unpaid care work. Women devote 1 to 3 hours more a day 
				to housework than men do; 2 to 10 times the amount of time a day to care (for children, elderly, and the sick), and 1 to
				 4 hours less a day to market activities.</p><br>
			<p><strong>*</strong>Women currently make up about three quarters of the world's poor; however, they perform more 
				than half of all economic activity in developing countries and represent an estimated 40 per cent of the global workforce.</p><br>

			<p><strong>*</strong>One billion young people will reach working age in the next decade, over half of these women. Providing them 
				with the opportunity to gain employment at a decent wage is a global challenge.</p><br>
			<h2>Importance of Women Economic Empowerment</h2>
			<p><strong>*</strong>When a woman is empowered, her voice becomes an integral part of household decision-making.</p><br>
			<p><strong>*</strong>Empowered women are able to promote and spend their own money on health, nutrition and their children's education. </p><br>
			<p><strong>*</strong>Economic independence & empowerment improves women's lives.</p><br>
			<p><strong>*</strong>They have a greater say in issues around their own fertility, and are more ready to stand up to threats of violence.</p><br>
			<p><strong>*</strong>When a woman is empowered, she gets greater decision-making responsibility, higher income, and smaller family size.</p><br>
			<h2>Our Approach</h2>
			<p>HMI Project ACE (African Women Empowerment Programs) is training women on various vocational skills and gives them technical support in form of advising on best suppliers, best markets, suggesting innovative activities to avoid market saturation and linking beneficiaries to each other so that they can complement each other's activities.
					For the empowerment of women to have lasting impacts, HMI is igniting dialogs and raising consciousness so that the social construction of gender, which subordinates women in the family, class, religion or society, can be changed.</p><br>
					<p>HMI is working out modalities to implement a micro credit program that would lend cash to women in other to startup a business on their own to support their families and finance genuine credit needs of the poor especially women in the rural and vulnerable communities.</p><br>
					<p>HMI engages the women in an open inclusive interactive gateway on the web portal www.hermatterinitiative.org. This gateway provides opportunities for the beneficiaries to find and share resources and learning tools; connect with peers and experts; and to discuss, generate new ideas and advocate for women's economic empowerment. It brings together a 
					diverse range of partners, networks and members from various organizations, private sector, government, academia and civil society.</p><br>
