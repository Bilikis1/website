						<p>Project HAP(Health Awareness Program) had successfully achieved its objectives. It was a session of meaningful value addition as beneficiaries which included adolescent girls, pregnant women, lactating mothers and young women of age reproductive  were made aware of the local health issues affecting their communities and their doubts were cleared on specific questions.
							This is evident in the feedback received from the beneficiaries on the effectiveness of the programs.</p><br> 
						<h2>Maman Imam from Randan Ruwa Community</h2>
							<p>She couldn't hold her joy when she said, “I have never witnessed a thing like this before, 
								the programs held in our village was like a messiah, the screening conducted, the health talks and the free distribution of
								mosquito net, sanitary pad and detergents really impacted our lives a lot.</p>
								<p>The only place we see doctors and nurses is in the hospital when we manage to go, but HMI brought doctors and nurses to our doorsteps. We now know how to stay healthy, 
								take care of our families and maintain an hygiene environment. Thank you HMI”.</p><br>

						<h2>Shafa from Angwanbiri Community</h2>
						<p>She had this to say, “Before now I do not know how to manage menstruation neither did I know anything about menstrual hygiene, I have been doing it all wrongly. 
							But with help of Her Matter Initiative (HMI), my dignity is restored”. </p><br>
					<h2>Kudu, Gbaiko Community</h2>
	
					<p>A mother and a beneficiary in the local village of Gbaiko, said, “the health education talk held in our village about maternal health, nutrition and so non was an eye opener and truly enlightening. It gave me a good insight on how to take care of my family, 
						deal with common ailment for my child and to maintain good hygiene. I am happy and my child is happy”.</p><br>
					 
				</div>
				<div class="four"></div>
				<div class="one">
						<p>These were unchartered territories. We have successfully been able to implement project HAP (Health Awareness Program) and impacted the lives of over 300 families across various  villages .
