            <h2>The Project “Make Nigeria Better”</h2> 
            <p>HMI has the willingness and commitment to contribute to our national development and to make the needed sacrifices to ensure the ideals we want to see in our country Nigeria are actualized.</p> 
            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>The project “Make Nigeria Better” is a passionate step taken by Female Youth Network (FYN)-HMI.
                It is designed to using the strongest societal problem-solving strategies such as education, door-to-doo
                r awareness campaign programmes, conferences and sensitization to reach out, mobilize, re-orientate and build the
                capacity of young women and youths in and out of schools on the ethics and rudiments of peace, mindfulness, good
                leadership and non-violence, emphasizing on the need for them to be fully involved in the entire process of actualization of a ‘Better Nigeria’.</p><br>
            <p>The project intends building young people into Ambassadors of positive change in their homes, schools and 
                communities to shun violence, refuse to be influenced by conflict entrepreneurs and used for any form of 
                conflict during and after elections, but insist on being agents of peace, good governance and better societies.</p><br> 
            <p>Effective information dissemination mechanisms already developed and in use will be strengthened and new 
                ones introduced to ensure the far-reaching impact. The Make Nigeria Better project will use the various 
                media outlet like the social media, press, radio, TV and other means such as seminars and workshops as 
                tools for training youth to build knowledge, self-esteem and positive attitude to support the set goals of the project.</p>
            <h2>Background Information</h2> 
            <p>Many studies have suggested that youth are prosecutors of most of the election-related and often times; they are at the heart of 
                it because of the vulnerability due to low level of economic status, ignorance and illiteracy among others. The enormous implication 
                is that young people living in these situations are easily targeted, separated from their families and rational minds, and recruited 
                or trained to engage in carrying out the related violence.</p><br> 
            <p>Youth participate in violence for many reasons: lack of hope for the future; limited economic opportunities; 
                traditional structures that neglect the voices of young people; and broken ties with families and communities.
                These factors contribute to a sense of loss and a lack of sense of belonging.</p><br>
            <p>To reduce this negative involvement of the Nigerian Youths, especially in elections and other events that often spark up 
                tension and tendency of violence, this project is committed to redirecting youth potential to productive ventures that empower
                them with knowledge and skills in peace building leadership development, as they are made ambassadors of change.</p><br>
            <p>Young people today constitute roughly one-fifth of the world’s population. The vast majority lives in developing countries.
                Many members of this generation face challenges such as limited access to resources, education, training, employment and broader economic development opportunities. In sub-Saharan Africa more than 20 percent of young people are not even literate and urban-rural literacy gaps remain notable.</p> 
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>To ensure that youths most especially the female youths are involved in good-governance processes as ambassadors of peace and 
                positive change.</p>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>* To advocate for a credible, free and fair elections and to ensure that all votes count.</p><br>
            <p>* To sensitize and increase the capacity of young women and youths in peace building    and leadership development projects in Nigeria.</p><br>
            <p>* To educate the young women and youths on their roles and rights to fully participate in   democratic governance and assist 
            them to achieve same.</p><br>
            <p>* To develop the young women and youths into change ambassadors, working to step down to them the message of peaceful 
            co-existence, forgiveness, mindfulness to others and supporting good leadership.</p><br>
            <p>* To advocate for creation of policies that encourage widespread involvement of youth in   
            the process of peace building and democratic governance.</p><br> 
            <h2>Activities</h2> 
            <p> <span class="bold">Training:</span> Young people will be empowered with knowledge and skills as change   ambassadors, understanding first their roles and rights, the ethics and ideals of a true democratic leadership process and all the basics of mindfulness, love and peace building.</p><br>
            <p> <span class="bold">Media Engagement:</span> This medium will also be used to educate and inspire youth to join our list of change ambassadors in large number, supporting the cause for peace, good leadership and non-violence. </p><br>
            <p> <span class="bold">Conference:</span> Within the duration of the present project, trained change ambassadors within main coverage area will form delegations to hold conferences with youth in other local governments, educating and inspiring them to preach peace, promote love, mindfulness and good leadership. </p><br> 
            <p> <span class="bold">Advocacy Program:</span> Will involve many projects such as youth change ambassadors reaching other youth with project related messages, visitations to community heads, churches, mosques, parents, teachers and other opinion leaders to mobilize and encourage everyone working to create positive change. </p><br>
            <p> <span class="bold">Information and Awareness Centers:</span> These centers will be quickly set-up with volunteers as focal points and the existing ones strengthened with ICT tools to enhance communications and timely information delivery to youth, Internet and mobile telecommunication based services will be utilized via these platforms to massively reach the youth. Flyers, handbills and magazines etc on peace and good governance will also be made available for distribution to the public. </p><br>
            <p> <span class="bold">Campaign and Awareness Program:</span> This will serve as a medium to mobilize and sensitize youth to continue to be agent of peace and good leadership. Buses will also be used with loudspeakers and microphones to implement this activity on busy streets and market places. </p><br>
