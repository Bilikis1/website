				<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
				<p>Female literacy is very low in rural communities; they believe that educating girls is of no use. It is also believed that girls are born to serve the household, support mothers at home and be good wife. Besides, girls have no decision making power in the society as they are regarded as inferior to men. Girls are kept away from formal schooling and they are forced to marry in their teenage years. The parents are less aware about the benefits of educating girls. Therefore the main aim of the project is to improve female literacy in the rural villages by raising awareness about the importance of girl's education and supporting girls from poor families into education. This will motivate parents to educate their daughters ands hence improve the number of girls in schooling.</p><br><br>
 
				<p>The problem of girls is the problem of the society as a whole. Their challenges should be counteracted to create better world for women.  An educated girl will be a mother in the future 
				and there is ample evidence to suggest that an educated mother ensures that her children will get an education regardless of gender,
				 brings up healthier babies, has better family planning and they also participate in income generating activities and community social
				  activities.</p>

				<p>Hence, this is a more reliable and sustainable approach to poverty reduction and wellbeing of the poorest in rural 
				communities. To this end HMI is in the vanguard of empowering girls through education.</p>
				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<p>HMI project PROG is a long term continuous project that provides holistic support to poor girls in vulnerable communities. 
				Targeted supports covers school fees, uniforms, school bags, writing materials (books, pencils, biro, etc), electronic
				learning devices like computers, teaching resources, such as stationery, chalk and black boards. 
				This encourages children to learn and boost their morale.</p>
				<h2>Target Beneficiaries</h2>
				<p>The project targets the most and disadvantaged girls who are mostly orphans and at the highest risk of dropping out of school. The project also involves working closely with girls after they leave school to help in the vulnerable period between childhood and adulthood.</p><br><br> 
			</div>
			<div class="four"></div>
			<div class="one">
				<p>Project PROG fully support the creation of student learning activities that shall provide academic enrichment opportunities during non-school hours for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools. The project shall help students meet the recommended student standards in core academic subjects, such as science and arts subjects and language subjects; offer students a broad array of enrichment activities that can complement their regular academic program.</p><br><br> 
				<p>However, financial constraints have become bottleneck for the realization of this objective.  
				Funding is therefore needed to provide sustainable interventions and support for the project.
				It is on this note that we are humbly calling upon various funding organizations, government institutions and philanthropic 
				individuals to give a helping hand towards the realization and sustainability of this project.</p><br><br>

			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>To improve the educational status of girls to meet the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs).</p> 
			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<p><b>*</b>Promotion of up-to-standard girl- child education especially those with inability to  afford  higher costly  education offered in the neighbouring schools.</p>
			<p><strong>*</strong>To increase enrollment of students in the school.</p> 
			<p><strong>*</strong>To initiate the community to advocate for poor girls to have access to education.</p> 
			<p><strong>*</strong>To increase the access of poor girls to education. </p>
			<p><strong>*</strong>To increase school retention rate especially for girls in rural areas.</p>
			<p><strong>*</strong>To change the life condition of poor girls through education.</p>
			<p><strong>*</strong>To Eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education with a focus on ensuring girls' full equal access to achievement in basic education.</p>    
			<p><strong>*</strong>To promote and create public awareness of the importance of girls' education and empowerment at all levels. 
			<h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
			<p>This begins with stakeholder consultation plan with the members of the community in other to review the current situation, particularly situation of girls schooling environment and education system. A baseline data of the village is collected on the situation. Cost of schooling and uniform per girl and motivation of parents, teachers and local community is identified at the beginning. There is a continuous monitoring of the process through visits to the family and school to collect attendance of girls in the scheme and their progress monthly. This is fed back to respective donors every three months. The information collected is be analyzed in other to establish a long-term sustainable monitoring policy.</p><br><br> 
			<p>In parallel with the above strategy to manage the project in the future, donors will provide various organisational and personal capacity development resources to manage the project effectively and efficiently. </p><br><br> 

			<p>Similarly, HMI has the responsibility to manage, monitor, report to it stakeholders and demonstrating that resources are being spent efficiently. Finally, at the end of pilot year, our donors will make a project visit to analyse the efficiency, impacts and motivation of the beneficiaries and local community. This would further assure our donors and partners of HMI effective project management and the need to sustain the project.</p>
