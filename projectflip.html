			<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>Functional Literacy Programme for Women is a community level project introduced by Her Matter Initiative (HMI). The project aims to teach illiterate women how to read and write in addition to acquisition of functional skills, which involves training in handcrafts, production, cookery and peace education. The project touches all aspects of literacy, which involves the ability to read, write, calculate, speak, and understand, as well as sign (for the Deaf) and communicate in other forms of language. The project also focuses on basic skills, which are the additional skills a learner needs to use their literacy skills, such as, digital technology, interpersonal skills, problem solving and critical thinking. The bedrock of any meaningful development of any nation.</p><br>
            <p>Through the contributions of trained volunteer tutors, one-on-one tutoring held at learning center convenient to both the tutor and learner, there are free weekly classes in which we teach reading, writing, numeracy and self-management skills to women with developmental challenges. The class also focus on employment goals.  Through training and support, we help build the skills and abilities of our volunteer tutors so that they gain confidence and fulfillment in teaching the beneficiaries to read.</p><br>

            <h2>Implementation Methodology and Strategy </h2>	
            <p>A preliminary analysis of learners' needs is made taking into account their real-life situations. This analysis informs the 
                design of teaching materials and educational content built around the learner. This includes basic literacy, numeracy and 
                life skills relating to the economic and socio-cultural development of young and adult women of child-bearing age. 
                The projects ensure that lectures are delivered in local languages in other to capture the attention of the learners most 
                especially the rural women. The programmes also enable timetable flexibility, such as evening classes in our learning centers;
                this is to accommodate young women who are wives, mothers, and those that have work or chores to do. </p><br>

            <p>Curriculum includes reading, writing, computer training skills, mathematics, English as a Second or Other Language (ESOL), The teaching of English speaking, listening, reading and writing skills. </p><br>

			<p>The learning materials are based on content relating to the above themes, selected after an analysis of the learners needs. Materials include a teaching guide for instructors, learner textbooks, reading books for newly literate learners, posters, flipcharts and abacuses. The instructors guide is designed to help in the preparation of teaching and learning activities, and contains a list of the various themes and steps to be followed in implementing the curriculum in subjects such as mathematics and social environment. There is also material for practical activities such as knitting, sewing, production of liquid soaps and catering. </p><br>
            <h2>Recruitment and training of facilitators</h2>
            <p>Instructors are generally recruited as volunteers.  Instructors are former students or newly literate adults who must pass an exam assessing whether or not they fulfill the selection criteria and have an appropriate level of education. </p><br>
            <h2>Enrolment of learners</h2>
            <p>As well as adult women, the programme also targets young women over the age of 15 and people from some ethnic groups. Participants are divided into two groups according to their age groups.  One for adult women and the other for young women over the age of 15. One cohort has classes in the morning and the other one has evening classes with the same instructor.</p><br>
            <h2>Assessment of learning outcomes</h2>
            <p>In the literacy aspect, the learners are assessed by the instructors at two points during their training. Their progress is assessed in each of the subjects offered. They sit attainment evaluation tests at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the courses. </p><br>
            <h2>Sustainability of the Project </h2>
            <p>Her Matter Initiative (HMI) will continue to provide assistance to the communities through its project FLIP. We are committed to the Millennium Development Goals. This Functional Literacy Programme for Women is a small significant glimpse into some of the women upliftment activities that we undertake. Funding is therefore needed in order to best realize the goal of succeeding in this initiative. It is on this note that we are calling upon funding organizations, partners and generous individuals to give a helping hand towards the realization and sustainability of this project. Through this, the communities are provided with helpful interventions and hopeful information and assistance. </p><br>
