			<h1>PROJECT HAP<br>(Health Awareness Program)</h1>
		</div>
			
		<div class="projecthap">
			<div class="one">
				<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
				<p>The vulnerable and underserved communities suffer from poor health status which is associated with a high mortality burden and multiple co-morbidities. Disease epidemics are strongly correlated with cramped habitats, leading to rapid spread of vector-borne and respiratory diseases under the conditions of poor sanitation, inadequate access to nutrition, electricity, clean water, health care and  exposure to environmental pollution.</p><br> 

				<p>Apart from these, their situation is vulnerable because of lack of education, public health awareness, social exclusion, 
					ineffective outreach and lack of economic resources. For the vulnerable groups, the first choice is not to seek care, 
					but to self-medicate and to avoid approaching the public health system. They often opt for more accessible but poorly 
					qualified private practitioners or the attendant in a pharmacy, who being untrained, follows irrational practices.</p>  
					<h2>Project Description</h2>
					<p>Considering the entire picture, Her Matter initiative (HMI) took the initiative of introducing Project HAP (Health Awareness Program).</p>
				
			</div>
			<div class="two"></div>
			<div class="one">
					
				 <p>With the aim to provide underserved and vulnerable communities in Nigeria with diagnosis, information dissemination, 
					 preventive healthcare practices, health education and to generate awareness on how to maintain hygiene, take proper care 
					 of their health, stay safe and maintain a healthy lifestyle while undertaking various preventive measures. In addition, 
					 they are also spurred to boost up their daily nutrition intake.</p><br>
				<p>The program shall offer three (3) main categories of activities; Voluntary Health Screenings, 
					Health Education and Demonstration of Health and Safety Related Skills which would require the expertise of resource
					 persons/specialists (including Gynaecologists, Ophthalmologists, ENT specialist, Orthopaedic Surgeons. Other health 
					 professionals such as nurses, midwifes laboratory technicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, optometrists, 
					 clinical psychologists, medical social workers and pharmacists etc. will also be required.</p> 
					 <a href="images/HAP-component.jpg">COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT</a>
				<h2>Goal</h2>

				<p>The goal of Project HAP (Health Awareness Program) is to promote healthy lifestyle amongst families residing in underserved and vulnerable communities by
					delivering sustainable interventions that lead to significant improvements in healthy practices, hygiene and restoration of dignity.</p>
				 
			</div>
			<div class="four"></div>

				<h2>Project Site</h2>

				<p>HMI leads the implementation of project HAP activities in Nigeria, while focusing on the sustainability of the various components
					 of the program.</p>
				<h2>Objectives</h2>
				<p><strong>*</strong>Increase health awareness by providing health education, screenings, activities, 		materials, 		demonstrations, 	and information.</p>
				<p><strong>*</strong>Increase awareness of local, state, and national health services and resources.</p>
				<p><strong>*</strong>Motivate participants to make positive health behavior changes.</p>
				<p><strong>*</strong>Teach self-care practices.</p><br>
				<h2>Theme</h2>
				<p>Healthy Family, Healthy Community.</p><br>
			</div>
			<div class="six"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="basehap">
				<h2>Target Beneficiaries</h2>

				<p>The framework of Project HAP (Health Awareness Program) would systematically and consciously target the Families, Women, Adolescent Girls and Young Women of Reproductive age residing in underserved and vulnerable communities in Nigeria. </p><br>

				<h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>

				<p>Door-to-door preintervention survey was conducted through an interview using a pretested questionnaire. The team consisted of nurse midwife, doctor, village head, HMI community liaison officer and volunteers. The oldest member or any woman who was able to give information about  all members of the family was interviewed.</p><br>
				
				<p>The heath awareness campaign was conducted in various villages. Invitation was printed in pamphlets and was given door-to-door in the whole village. Banners were placed in the village to increase the awareness about the awareness program. Cultural night was held on Sunday evening so that maximum number of people in the village could attend. In the cultural night, a skit was performed, followed by the speech and interaction of palliative care team with village head and people in the village. Participants were made aware of the health awareness program and about the role of the community in contributing to the success of the project. This information was expected to spread to the community through these participants. The overall aim was to improve the community participation and identification of volunteers for providing assistance in the needed areas.</p><br>
				<h2>Recruitment of Youth Healthcare Volunteers</h2>

				<p>The selection of the healthcare volunteers is based on specific criteria to include aptitude, skills and local language fluency.</p><br>
				<h2>Training and Capacity Building for the Community Health Volunteer</h2>
				<p>The community health volunteers are formally trained to ensure they are adequately prepared for a successful program by instructors from community and health field, who were aware of the local healthcare needs. The Training workshop commenced with a brief introduction on the objectives of the program which is followed by talks presentation by the volunteers in local dialects to ensure they give maximum participation and hence, highest impact.</p><br> 
				
				<h2>Sustained Interventions</h2>

				<p>Her Matter Initiative (HMI) will continue to provide assistance to the communities through its project HAP. We are committed to the Millennium Development Goals. This health awareness program is a small significant glimpse into some of the public health activities that we undertake. Through the generosity of our donors, partners and engagement of healthcare professionals and volunteers, the communities are provided with helpful interventions and hopeful information and assistance.</p><br>
				<h2>Innovative Approach</h2>
				<p>This project is unique and innovative because not only does it build capacity within the local health workers, it also provided public health information to the villages by their own members, in their own language, in their local centre, at a time where the numbers were maximum. This gave the greatest impact of the project.</p><br>
